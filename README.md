# Void
Void's a string remover/cleaner for process hacker. This is a better alternative to my old one (https://github.com/Tehnicki1/string-cleaner). The string scanner is from lvstrng's sstool (https://github.com/LvStrnggg/ss/) and it's been turned into a deleter.

# How to use ❓
1. Download void.exe
2. Enter the PID of the process you want to delete the strings from.
3. Enter the strings you want to delete, they are separated by a comma so for example the strings would be: string1,string2,string3
4. Wait for all the strings to delete.
